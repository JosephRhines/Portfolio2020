Description: I built this website from scratch with the goal of replicating a responsive bio page.

Steps taken to accomplish building the webpage:

Index.html
1. I created the html document 
2. I created the links 
3. I added a navbar with the webpage links inside of it. (navbar was from bootstrap)
4. I aligned the links to the right
5. I copied the javascript links from bootstrap to enable the hamburger menu to work in mobile mode
6. I created a div with the container bootstrap class to incorporate the main content of the page
7. I incorporated an image of myself and paragraphs in the div I created on the index.html page
8. I created a sticky footer

Portfolio.html
1. I created the portfolio.html document
2. I created the links to the other pages and put them in the navbar from bootstrap
3. I created the the div container to house the main content of the page
4. I added the images to rows and columns
5. I added the sticky footer

Contact.html
1. I created the contact.html document
2. I created the links to the other pages and put them in the navbar from bootstrap
3. I created the the div container to incoporate the form I received from bootstrap
4. I added the submit button from another form and incoporated it into the form on my website
5. I added the sticky footer

CSS
1. I added the navbar-brand class to change the text color of my name to white 
2. I added an h1 and h2 class to change the header backgrounds to darkcyan
2. I added the .header class to change the div containers background to white and add padding
3. I created a span2 class to add padding so my About Me Header could move a little down from the top 
4. I changed the background color to lightgrey
5. I created a button class to change the color of the submit button to darkcyan
6. I added a footer class to style the footer
