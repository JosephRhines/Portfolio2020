                    My name is Joseph Rhines and I am from Burnsville, MN. I currently live in Eden
                    Prairie, MN. I live near by the downtown area and enjoy being so close to the mall.
                    <br>
                    I want to to be able to become a good developer.
                    Im trying really hard to make that happen. I'm spending hours watching youtube videos and looking
                    at other resouces with the goal of improving craft. I was enrolled in this coding bootcamp a around
                    a year ago.
                    I had to discontinue the program I was in because my wife had a new job opportunity she wanted to
                    pursue and one of
                    us had to stay home to take care of our son. I ended up staying at home to take care of him and I
                    enjoyed my time
                    with him. Now I'm back and I want to finish what I started a year a go. This has been a chanllening
                    adventure but
                    I am learning alot. This is the first time i'm doing a class over zoom and I really like it. I'ts
                    really nice that
                    I don't have to pay for parking like I did when I was coming to the U of M a year ago.

                </p>
                <p>Please bare with me, because I would like to tell you alittle more about myself below.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Me and my Son go to an American Ninja Warrior gym in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The gym is called
                    Obstacle Academy and we
                    have around 5 people that go to the gym that has been on the American Ninja Warrior show. My son is
                    on the advanced team
                    at the gym and I go to open gyms and do some competitions from time to time. Sometimes I wonder
                    which craft is more
                    challenging. If I had to guess I would say coding, but ninja warrior has helped me mentally to face
                    challenges.
                </p>
